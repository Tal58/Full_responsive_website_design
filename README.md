## Full Responsive Multi Page website Design 

This project was completed thanks to the Easy Tutorials (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYRda7UtuhA). 
The main aim of this project is to improve my HTML/CSS skills. Also, basic JavaScript code is embedded to make an action on a small size of web page.  The desktop and mobile versions of the web page are as follows;

<img src="desktop_version.gif" width="400" align="left" alt="desktop_version">
<br>
<img src="mobile_version.gif" width="400" align="right" alt="mobile_version">
<br>
<br>
